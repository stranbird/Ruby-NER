{NEW YORK/ns} ({Dow Jones/nt})-- Crude Oil futures are higher Wednesday on a drop in {U.S./ns} crude oil stocks and a weakening dollar. Light, sweet crude for January delivery recently traded 37 cents, or 0.5%, higher at $72.99 a barrel on the {New York Mercantile Exchange/nt}. Brent crude on the ICE futures exchange traded 13 cents, or 0.2%, lower at $75.06 a barrel. Data from {the U.S. Energy Information Administration/nt} showed a 3.823 million barrel draw in crude oil stocks, surprising analysts who had anticipated only a 600,000 barrel increase."We're responding a little bit to the draw in crude," said {Brad Samples/nr}, analyst with {Summit Energy/nt} in {Louisville/ns}, {Kentucky/ns}. The data, though, proved a "mixed picture," said {Mike Zarembski/nr}, senior commodities analyst with {OptionsXpress/nt} in {Chicago/ns}. It was "not as bullish as {the American Petroleum Institute/nt}," he said of the 5.815 million barrel drop the trade group reported late Tuesday. Despite the overall draw in crude stocks, there was another big rise in inventories at Cushing, the delivery point for the WTI contract. The {EIA/nt} reported a 2.5 million barrel build to 33.4 million barrels. Stocks here are now approaching record levels. Oil prices had initially fallen on the release of the data as it showed a larger than expected increase in oil product inventories, that {Zarembski/nr} said was disappointing. Gasoline stocks climbed 2.253 million barrels, compared with forecasts for a 1.5 million barrel gain, while distillate stocks, a category that includes heating oil and diesel, rose 1.619 million barrels compared with expectations of a 500,000 barrel decline. Both gasoline and heating oil prices moved lower after the data. Front-month January reformulated gasoline blendstock, or RBOB, recently traded 21 points, or 0.1%, lower at $1.9225 a gallon. January heating oil recently traded 74 points, or 0.4%, lower at $1.9835 a gallon. The report did not show any recovery in oil consumption in the {U.S./ns} with total products supplied--used as a proxy for demand--falling 3% year-on-year over the last four weeks to average 18.5 million barrels per day. "I'd say, just solely on the inventory report, crude would probably be following products lower," said {Samples/nr}. "But I think because equities are up and the dollar's off you're seeing some of that relationship at play in crude". Oil prices were also pushed higher after the release of the data by a weakening in the dollar. Oil tends to rise on a weaker dollar as it makes the price of the dollar denominated commodity cheaper to other currency holders. {The Dow Jones Industrial Average/nt} was most recently up 30 points at 10316. -By {Claire Rangel/nr}, {Dow Jones Newswires/nt}; 212-416-2846; claire.rangel@dowjones.com. 
{LONDON/ns} -- {U.K. Treasury/nt} chief {Alistair Darling/nr} said Wednesday the government will impose a one-time 50% charge on large bank bonuses, responding to increasingly sour public sentiment toward the banking sector in a largely neutral prebudget report.Laying out plans for borrowing and spending, Mr. Darling said the bonus measure, which will be borne by the employer, would apply to bonuses in excess of ￡25,000 ($40,725) at all {U.K./ns} banks and building societies, and foreign banks with branches or subsidiaries in the {U.K./ns} The measure starts Wednesday and will end April 5.View Full ImageAssociated Press {Alistair Darling/nr} leaves {the Treasury/nt} in {London/ns} Wednesday to deliver his prebudget report.News that many banks are set to pay bonuses has piled pressure on the government to rein in the huge pay deals that some blame for fueling the excessive risk-taking that led to the global credit crunch and ensuing economic crisis.Mr. Darling has repeatedly urged the banking sector to show restraint in its remuneration, saying bankers owe it to taxpayers, who committed billions of pounds to bail out financial institutions during the crisis.With an election due within the next six months, Mr. Darling's prebudget report included other measures that would likely be popular with voters, including an extension of several plans to help smaller firms and mortgage borrowers.However, he also renewed his promise to halve the budget deficit within four years, with a squeeze on public spending from 2011, including a two-year pay increase cap of 1% for public-sector workers from 2011. And he announced an additional increase in employer and employee national-insurance contributions from 2011. {The Treasury/nt} expects this to raise several billion pounds.The chancellor of the exchequer defended his decision not to speed up his debt reduction plan, saying the four-year target means reducing the deficits "in an orderly way.""I believe this is a sensible timetable," he said. "To consolidate too soon, too quickly or too indiscriminately, as some have proposed, risks delaying the recovery and threatening a longer recession."But Mr. Darling's decision to stick by his gradual debt-reduction plan could provoke concern from credit ratings agencies who have warned the {U.K./ns}'s AAA sovereign debt rating might be at risk if fiscal discipline isn't tightened.Related Reading{The Treasury/nt}'s Plans and Promises Full Prebudget Report (3.87 MB) The Source: Recap of {Darling/nr}'s Prebudget Report The Source: Vote: Is a one-time tax on {U.K./ns} bankers' bonuses the right move? The financial markets took the report in stride, with the pound little changed against the dollar and the euro, while gilt prices rose as {the U.K.'s Debt Management Office/nt} announced only a small increase in debt issuance for the current financial year.Mr. Darling made only small changes to his growth and borrowing forecasts as he argued that the government mustn't yet withdraw support measures for the economy.He forecast an output contraction of 4.75% for 2009 -- a larger contraction than the April budget prediction of 3.5%. He said the economy will return to growth in the fourth quarter and that in 2010, output will expand by 1.0%-1.5%, unchanged from the previous forecast. The economy will grow by around 3.5% in 2011 and 2012, he said in a prediction close to that of {the Bank of England/nt}.The chancellor also made only slight changes to his borrowing predictions, lifting forecast net borrowing by just ￡4 billion to a total ￡707 billion by the 2013 financial year, which ends in March 2014.Mr. Darling said there is growing confidence that the global economy is recovering. Despite predicting a return to growth from the turn of the year, he added that the government "can't be complacent" about the economy and it will therefore continue to support the economy.Mr. Darling said unemployment will keep growing next year despite rising less than expected thus far. The claimant count is expected to peak at around 1.75 million in the middle of next year. However, the Treasury effectively indicated something of a recovery in the jobs market, saying the numbers claiming jobless benefits should fall to 1.5 million by end-2012.Mr. Darling said he would change a plan to guarantee people under 25 a job or training -- guaranteeing them a post after six months without work, instead of a full year. He also announced the continuation of a plan to allow smaller firms to defer some tax payments to maintain more working capital.The chancellor confirmed the government will increase the basic state pension by 2.5% from April despite retail prices -- to which the pension is linked -- being much lower.He also said the Value Added Tax rate will return to 17.5% at the end of year from the current, temporary rate of 15.0%.Public spending outside of frontline services for health, education and police will be squeezed tightly from 2011 when the recovery is entrenched, he said.Current spending is now forecast to rise by an average inflation-adjusted 0.8% from 2011-12 to 2014-15. The government will cut its state pension contributions, saving ￡1 billion, Mr. Darling said, adding that public sector wages won't rise by more than 1% in the two years from 2011.The chancellor reduced the expected cost of the bank rescue packages to around ￡10 billion from the maximum ￡50 billion set aside in April and said the government won't go ahead of its planned increase in the threshold at which inheritance tax is charged.The prebudget report is the last before a general election that must be held before June 2010. {The opposition Conservative party/nt} has held a double-digit lead in opinion polls for most of this year but their advantage has softened somewhat in recent weeks.—{Paul Hannon/nr}, {Joe Parkinson/nr} and {Natasha Brereton/nr} contributed to this article.
{WASHINGTON/ns}, Dec 9 (Reuters) - {U.S. Treasury/nt} Secretary {Timothy Geithner/nr} on Wednesday extended the government's $700 billion financial bailout fund to October next year, saying the economy still faced "significant challenges."Geithner, in letters to congressional leaders, pledged to deploy no more than $550 billion from {the Troubled Asset Relief Program/nt}, allowing for some of the unspent funds to reduce budget deficits.The extension, opposed by many Republicans, will allow the {Obama administration/nt} to tap the financial rescue program for further efforts to fight home foreclosures and to ease credit access for small businesses as it seeks to spur job growth."This extension is necessary to assist {American/ns} families and stabilize financial markets because it will, among other things, enable us to continue to implement programs that address housing markets and the needs of small businesses, and to maintain the capacity to respond to unforeseen threats," {Geithner/nr} told {U.S. House/nt} Speaker {Nancy Pelosi/nr} and Senate {Democratic/nt} leader {Harry Reid/nr}.{Congress/nt} created the program last year in the throes of the financial crisis. Under the law, {Geithner/nr} had to decide by Dec. 31 whether to extend the program to Oct. 3, 2010, or let it expire -- a move that would have forfeited about $330 billion in funds that have not been disbursed.But {Geithner/nr} warned that withdrawing programs aimed at containing the crisis too early could prolong the economic downturn."Too many American families, homeowners and small businesses still face severe financial pressure," he said. "Further, the recovery of our financial system remains incomplete. And near-term shocks to that system could undermine the economic recovery we have seen to date."Republicans immediately criticized the decision, arguing that the TARP program should die and unspent funds be returned to taxpayers.Democrats "love the idea of using TARP as a piggy bank for more and more federal handouts," said Senator {Judd Gregg/nr} of {New Hampshire/nt}, the top Republican on {the Senate Budget Committee/nt}."Using TARP authority for any purpose other than purchasing risky assets from troubled financial institutions to address an emergency in our financial system is inappropriate and illegal," {Gregg/nr} added.Geithner]PN said {the Treasury/nt} expects up to $175 billion in repayments from bailout recipients by the end of next year, with "substantial additional repayments thereafter."These funds, along with the $150 billion in TARP resources that will not be deployed, "should allow us to commit significant resources to pay down the federal debt over time and slow its growth rate over time." For a breakdown of how bailout funds have been used, please double click on [ID:nN0289041]{The Obama administration/nt} has said it expects the program will ultimately cost {U.S./ns} taxpayers at least $200 billion less than the $341 billion it had projected in August.This includes $25 billion of potential costs from commitments that will be made next year, commitments in 2010, the majority of which would come from "mitigating foreclosure for responsible American homeowners," {Geithner/nr} said.He said the new commitments would be limited to the housing market, capital for small banks and other efforts to boost small business lending, and increased support for the {Federal Reserve's Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility/nt}, which has been credited with reviving securitization of consumer, small business and commercial mortgage loans.The decision came as a TARP watchdog group, {the Congressional Oversight Panel/nt}, released a report saying that the program had failed to resolve key problems in the financial system, citing toxic assets still weighing down bank balance sheets, a sharp contraction of credit and the moral hazard associated with bailouts.It credited the program, which has helped prop up big financial firms like {Citigroup/nt} and insurer {AIG/nt}, with helping to stabilize financial markets, but said it was doing too little to stem home foreclosures, which could reach 13 million over the next five years.The panel's chairman, {Harvard Law School/nt} professor {Elizabeth Warren/nr}, said {the Obama administration/nt} would have to seek congressional approval if it wants to use any funds for jobs programs outside the financial sector.The program "is not simply a slush fund that can be used on anything anyone wants to do, no matter how worthy," she told {CNBC/nt} television.

{Xie Zhenhua/nr} said developed nations must commit to cuts of "at least 40 percent" by 2020 from 1990 levels. He said {Beijing/ns} was aiming for a legally binding treaty from the Dec. 7-18 talks, although hosts {Denmark/nt} have said that will be impossible.A successful outcome from the summit largely depends on agreement between {the United States/nt} and {China/nt}, which together generate 40 percent of global carbon emissions.But negotiations have been bogged down for months by rifts between developed and developing nations over who should cut emissions, by how much, and who should pay."I do hope that President {Obama/nr} can bring a concrete contribution to {Copenhagen/ns}," {Xie/nr} said in a rare interview.Asked if he meant something more than {Obama/nr} has proposed so far, a 3 percent cut from 1990 levels by 2020, {Xie/nr} said: "Yes." "The whole world is watching {the United States/nt}, and as long as they take on a good leadership role, then I think that we can make a large step forward in combating climate change." The head of {China/nt}'s delegation, who is deputy chairman of {the powerful National Development and Reform Commission/nt} ({NDRC/nt}), called for stronger action from rich nations a day after a senior member of his delegation slammed their existing commitments as unambitious and deceptive.{Xie/nr} initially told {Reuters/nr} rich countries should make emissions cuts of 25-40 percent versus 1990 levels by 2020, but clarified later that {China/nt} was sticking to its past insistence of cuts of "at least 40 percent".2050 GOAL "POSSIBLE" {Xie/nr} ruled out signing up to a long-term emissions cutting goal favoured by developed nations unless they took stronger steps to cut their output of greenhouse gases in the shorter-term and provided "sufficient, additional and sustainable" financial and technology help for poor countries."We do not deny the importance of a long-term target but I think a mid-term target is more important. We need to solve the immediate problem.""If the demands of developing countries can be satisfied I think we can discuss a (2050) emissions target," he added.He rejected a current {U.N./nt} proposal for fast-track funding of $10 billion a year from 2010-2012 as "not enough". {China/nt} wants developed countries to provide assistance worth 1 to 1.5 percent of their national income."I think there is a big gap between what has been proposed by the developed world and what is expected by the developing world or by scientific research," he said.{Xie/nr} said he preferred a final, legally binding agreement at the meeting in {Copenhagen/ns}, and it must respect previous {United Nations/nt} agreements including the {Kyoto/ns} Protocol and a road map to a deal laid out in {Bali/ns} two years ago.Hosts {Denmark/nt} say time has run out to agree a full text and are pushing instead for a strong political agreement next week, which could then be pinned down in a legal text in 2010.Many developing nations fear the rich world is trying to undermine the role of {the United Nations/nt} in the fight against climate change, in a bid to make it easier to whittle down their emissions and financial responsibilities to poor countries
A man writes, lives and loves in darkness. Fourteen years before, he was in a brutal car crash on the island of {Lanzarote/ns}. In the accident, he not only lost his sight, he also lost {Lena/nr}, the love of his life. This man uses two names: {Harry Caine/nr}, a playful pseudonym with which he signs his literary works, stories and scripts, and {Mateo Blanco/nr}, his real name, with which he lives and signs the film he directs. After the accident, {Mateo Blanco/nr} reduces himself to his pseudonym, {Harry Caine/nr}. If he can't direct films he can only survive with the idea that {Mateo Blanco/nr} died on {Lanzarote/ns} with his beloved {Lena/nr}. In the present day, {Harry Caine/nr} lives thanks to the scripts he writes and to the help he gets from his faithful former production manager, {Judit Garcia/nr}, and from {Diego/nr}, her son, his secretary, typist and guide. Since he decided to live and tell stories, {Harry/nr} is an active, attractive blind man who has developed all his other senses in order to enjoy life, on a basis of irony and self-induced amnesia. He has erased from his biography any trace of his first identity, {Mateo Blanco/nr}. One night {Diego/nr} has an accident and {Harry/nr} takes care of him (his mother, {Judit/nr}, is out of {Madrid/ns} and they decide not to tell her anything so as not to alarm her). During the first nights of his convalescence, {Diego/nr} asks him about the time when he answered to the name of {Mateo Blanco/nr}, after a moment of astonishment {Harry/nr} can't refuse and he tells {Diego/nr} what happened fourteen years before with the idea of entertaining him, just as a father tells his little child a story so that he'll fall asleep. The story of {Mateo/nr}, {Lena/nr}, {Judit/nr} and {Ernesto Martel/nr} is a story of 'amour fou,' dominated by fatality, jealously, the abuse of power, treachery and a guilt complex. A moving and terrible story, the most expressive image of which is the photo of two lovers embracing, torn into a thousand pieces.

{Chengdu/ns} does Best Service for Women's World Cup {Chengdu/ns} venue organizers have promised the best service during the tournament of the {FIFA/nt} Women’s World Cup {China/ns} 2007.      As one of the five match zones of {China/ns}, {Chengdu/ns} hosts the matches of {Group B/nt} teams from September 11-19 according to the race card. The four teams of {Group B/nt} include {the United States/nt}, {the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea/nt}, {Sweden/nt} and {Nigeria/nt}.     {Gu Jianming/nr}, secretary general of {Chengdu football association/nt}, said at a press conference that {the local organizing committee/nt} had done its utmost to serve the quadrennial tournament.      “We’ve prepared for a whole year and got ready to be a nice host,”he said.“Also we’ve worked hard as a team to solve problems involving in hosting the matches, such as security, traffic, medical and fan control,”he added.     One day after attending the opening ceremony and match of the {FIFA/nt} Women’s World Cup {China/ns} 2007, {Joseph S. Blatter/nr} received a president’s welcome in {Chengdu/ns} on Tuesday, where he was served with 180 minutes of sumptuous action inside the {Sports Center Stadium/ns}. First the {FIFA/nt} President took in {USA/nt}’s captivating 2-2 draw with {Korea DPR/nt}, and then he was captivated by the meeting between {Nigeria/nt} and {Sweden/nt}, which finished 1-1.      The experience confirmed his belief that {China/ns} is equipped to stage the biggest show on earth - the {FIFA/nt} World Cup.“When a country like {China/ns} is able to organize the Olympic Games with 27 or 28 sports and 10,000 or 12,000 athletes, and when they have shown their ability to organize the {FIFA/nt} Women’s World Cup and have already hosted the very first {FIFA/nt} U-16 World Championship in 1985, then obviously they are able to organize the {FIFA/nt} World Cup,”he said.     As the competition site to hold 2/3 of the Group matches, {Chengdu/ns} has an impressive achievement in ticket-selling. Each match will expect around 30,000 spectators in the {stadium/ns} with a capacity of just over 36,000. 
'Women's football more popular than ever'With just three days until the {FIFA/nt} Women's World Cup kicks off, the {Local Organising Committee/nt} ({LOC/nt}) for the {FIFA/nt} Women's World Cup held a press conference in {Shanghai/ns}. The meeting was attended by the Chairman of {the FIFA Committee for Women's Football and the FIFA Women's World Cup China 2007/nt} {Worawi Makudi/nr}; the Executive General Secretary of {the LOC/nt}, {Xue Li/nr}; {FIFA/nt} Director of Competitions {Jim Brown/nr}; {UNICEF/nt} Deputy Regional Director for {Asia/ns} and the {Pacific/ns} {Richard Bridle/nr}; and {Sun Wen/nr}, {FIFA/nt} Ambassador for Women's Football Development.{Worawi Makudi/nr}, Chairman of {the FIFA Committee for Women's Football and the FIFA Women's World Cup China 2007/nt}{China/ns}By returning to {China/ns}, the {FIFA/nt} Women's World Cup is returning to its roots. As we are all aware, football in its earliest form originated here on Chinese soil. Since it was founded, {FIFA/nt} has continually strived to promote women's football and the {FIFA/nt} Women's World Cup has an important role to play in this ongoing effort.PrizesFor the first time in the history of the event, {FIFA/nt} will be awarding prize money to the competitors. The winning team will be awarded one million {US/ns} dollars, the runners-up 800,000 USD, the third-placed team 650,000 USD, and the fourth-placed team 550,000 USD. Teams eliminated in the quarter-finals will be awarded 350,000 USD, while those eliminated in the second round will be awarded 250,000 USD. In all, a total of 6.4 million USD in prize money will be awarded.Television coverageThis year's {FIFA/nt} Women's World Cup will be the most watched in the history of the tournament. The competition will be broadcast to over 200 countries worldwide, which represents a 25 per cent increase on the {2003/nt} edition.Opening and closing ceremoniesFollowing careful deliberations, it has been decided that the opening and closing ceremonies will be held in a football-specific stadium ({Shanghai Hongkou Football Stadium/ns}). By holding the opening and closing ceremonies in a football-specific stadium as opposed to a general-purpose sports stadium, it will be possible to showcase the appeal of football more effectively.Achieving success at the {FIFA/nt} Women's World CupEvery team has the chance to become world champions. As for more specific details, I prefer not to make any predictions!{FIFA/nt} Women's Football SymposiumAs this year's competition draws to a close, we will be organising a special international women's football symposium.{Xue Li/nr}, Executive General Secretary of {the China 2007 LOC/nt}Ticket salesThus far, positive ticket sales have been reported. In addition to tickets already sold, most collective tickets on offer have already been reserved by organisations such as {companies/nt}, {schools/nt} and {public bodies/nt}. Tickets for the opening ceremony are in very high demand: we estimate that 80 per cent of tickets for the ceremony have been sold so far. Once the tournament begins, an average of 25,000-30,000 spectators are expected to attend each match. Those attending games in {Shanghai/ns} can expect a particularly exciting atmosphere.The advantages of the host teamAs regards {the China women's football team/nt}, a number of advantages have created favourable conditions for the team's success, including the familiar climate, environment and public support. However, success in the tournament will ultimately depend on the extent of the {China team/nt}'s achievements will depend on the players scoring goals.This year's competition will make a tremendous contribution towards developing and raising the profile of women's football in {China/ns}. In the past we have worked very hard in this respect, for example by organising football activities in {schools/nt} and {communities/nt}. I hope that this year's {FIFA/nt} Women's World Cup will inject new impetus and energy into the development of football in {China/ns}.The {FIFA/nt} Women's World Cup and the Olympic GamesThe {FIFA/nt} Women's World Cup is an official tournament; the demands are high, as are the standards. In some respects, the standards of this event even exceed those of the Olympic Games. In fact, the {FIFA/nt} Women's World Cup is a major sporting event in its own right. Next year {Tianjin/ns} and {Shanghai/ns} will also be hosting matches as part of the Olympic Football Tournament at {Beijing/ns} 2008. In this sense, the {FIFA/nt} Women's World Cup will serve as a trial run for the relevant preparations in the run-up to next year's Olympic Games.The competition and environmental protectionThroughout its preparations for the tournament, {the LOC/nt} has continually adhered to government regulations in upholding the principles of environmental protection.

We will also be implementing a non-smoking policy inside every {FIFA Women's World Cup stadium/ns} to ensure that spectators can enjoy the matches in a clean and pleasant environment.
A man writes, lives and loves in darkness. Fourteen years before, he was in a brutal car crash on the island of {Lanzarote/ns}. In the accident, he not only lost his sight, he also lost {Lena/nr}, the love of his life. This man uses two names: {Harry Caine/nr}, a playful pseudonym with which he signs his literary works, stories and scripts, and {Mateo Blanco/nr}, his real name, with which he lives and signs the film he directs. After the accident, {Mateo Blanco/nr} reduces himself to his pseudonym, {Harry Caine/nr}. If he can't direct films he can only survive with the idea that {Mateo Blanco/nr} died on {Lanzarote/ns} with his beloved {Lena/nr}. In the present day, {Harry Caine/nr} lives thanks to the scripts he writes and to the help he gets from his faithful former production manager, {Judit Garcia/nr}, and from {Diego/nr}, her son, his secretary, typist and guide. Since he decided to live and tell stories, {Harry/nr} is an active, attractive blind man who has developed all his other senses in order to enjoy life, on a basis of irony and self-induced amnesia. He has erased from his biography any trace of his first identity, {Mateo Blanco/nr}. One night {Diego/nr} has an accident and {Harry/nr} takes care of him (his mother, {Judit/nr}, is out of {Madrid/ns} and they decide not to tell her anything so as not to alarm her). During the first nights of his convalescence, {Diego/nr} asks him about the time when he answered to the name of {Mateo Blanco/nr}, after a moment of astonishment {Harry/nr} can't refuse and he tells {Diego/nr} what happened fourteen years before with the idea of entertaining him, just as a father tells his little child a story so that he'll fall asleep. The story of {Mateo/nr}, {Lena/nr}, {Judit/nr} and {Ernesto Martel/nr} is a story of 'amour fou,' dominated by fatality, jealously, the abuse of power, treachery and a guilt complex. A moving and terrible story, the most expressive image of which is the photo of two lovers embracing, torn into a thousand pieces.

As of 2009, it had assets of RMB 11 trillion (US$1.6 trillion), with over 18,000 outlets including 106 overseas branches and agents globally.[4]  This article or section may be slanted towards recent events. Please try to keep recent events in historical perspective. (September 2009) The bank's {Hong Kong/ns} operations are listed under the name {ICBC Asia/nt}. It has purchased the {Hong Kong/ns} subsidiary of {Fortis Bank/nt} and rebranded it under its own name on 10 October 2005.In the runup to its planned initial public offering, on 28 April 2006, three "strategic investors" injected US$3.7 billion into {ICBC/nt}.{Goldman Sachs/nt} purchased a 5.75% stake for US$2.6 billion, the largest sum {Goldman Sachs/nt} has ever invested.{Dresdner Bank/nt} (a wholly owned subsidiary of {Commerzbank/nt}) invested US$1 billion.[6]{American Express/nt} invested US$200 million.[6]{ICBC/nt} was simultaneously listed on both the {Hong Kong Stock Exchange/nt} and {Shanghai Stock Exchange/nt} on 27 October 2006. It was the world's largest IPO at that time valued at US$21.9 billion, surpassing the previous record US$18.4 billion IPO by {Japan/ns}'s {NTT DoCoMo/nt} in 1998.{China/ns}'s largest commercial bank was also the first company to debut simultaneously on both the {Hong Kong/ns} and {Shanghai/ns} stock exchanges.{ICBC/nt}raised at least US$14 billion in {Hong Kong/ns} (H-shares) and another US$5.1 billion in {Shanghai/ns} (A-shares). Due to heavy subscriptions, the greenshoe (i.e. over-allotment) placements were exercised and {ICBC/nt}'s take rose to US$21.9 billion (17% of {ICBC/nt}'s market value before the IPO), divided in US$16 billion in {Hong Kong/ns} and US$5.9 billion in {Shanghai/ns}. Following the global offering, the free float of shares was 22.14% of the market capitalization.At the end of its first day of trading, the bank's shares closed up almost 15% at HK$3.52 in {Hong Kong/ns}, compared with the listing price of HK$3.07, which was set at the top of the indicative range due to the strong demand. According to {Bloomberg/nr}, {ICBC/nt}'s market capitalisation at the end of trade based on its {Hong Kong/ns} shares was US$156.3 billion, making its equity the world's fifth highest among banks, just behind {JPMorgan Chase/nt}. Meanwhile, {ICBC/nt}'s A-shares recorded more modest gains and ended up 5.1% from the offering price of RMB 3.12.In August 2008, {ICBC/nt} became the second Chinese bank since 1991 to gain federal approval to establish a branch in{New York City/ns}.[8]{ICBC/nt} has 2.5 million corporate customers and 150 million individual customers.[9] In 2005, net profit was up 12.4% to RMB 33.7 billion, and the total loan balance was RMB 3,289.5 billion. Total liabilities are RMB 6,196.2 billion, up 11.2%.

As the 2005 annual report records, just under 5% of loans are classified as non-performing, in comparison with the majority of western banks who have lower NPL ratios ({US/ns} commercial banks around 1%).[15]
{Microsoft Corporation/nt} is a public multinational corporation headquartered in {Redmond/ns}, {Washington/ns}, {USA/ns} that develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of products and services predominantly related to computing through its various product divisions. Established on April 4, 1975 to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800, {Microsoft/nt} rose to dominate the home computer operating system (OS) market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by the Microsoft Windows line of OSs. {Microsoft/nt} would also come to dominate the office suite market with Microsoft Office. The company has diversified in recent years into the video game industry with the Xbox and its successor, the Xbox 360 as well as into the consumer electronics market with Zune and the Windows Phone OS. The ensuing rise of stock in the company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) made an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from {Microsoft/nt} employees.Primarily in the 1990s, critics contend the company used monopolistic business practices and anti-competitive strategies including refusal to deal and tying, put unreasonable restrictions in the use of its software, and used misrepresentative marketing tactics; both the {U.S. Department of Justice/nt} and {European Commission/nt} found the company in violation of antitrust laws. Known for its interviewing process with obscure questions, various studies and ratings were generally favorable to {Microsoft/nt}'s diversity within the company as well as its overall environmental impact with the exception of the electronics portion of the business.{Paul Allen/nr} and {Bill Gates/nr} (respectively) on October 19, 1981 in a sea of PCs after signing a pivotal contract. {IBM/nt} called {Microsoft/nt} in July 1980 inquiring about programming languages for its upcoming PC line after failed negotiations with another company, {IBM/nt} gave {Microsoft/nt} a contract to develop the OS for the new line of PCs.{Paul Allen/nr} and {Bill Gates/nr}, childhood friends with a passion in computer programming, were seeking to make a successful business utilizing their shared skills. The January 1975 issue of {Popular Electronics/nt} featured {Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems/nt}'s ({MITS/nt} ) Altair 8800 microcomputer. {Allen/nr} noticed that they could program a BASIC interpreter for the device; after a call from {Gates/nr} claiming to have a working interpreter, {MITS/nt} requested a demonstration. Since they didn't actually have one, {Allen/nr} worked on a simulator for the Altair while {Gates/nr} developed the interpreter. Although they developed the interpreter on a simulator and not the actual device, the interpreter worked flawlessly when they demonstrated the interpreter to {MITS/nt}  in {Albuquerque/ns} , {New Mexico/ns}  in March 1975; {MITS/nt}  agreed to distribute it, marketing it as Altair BASIC.They officially established {Microsoft/nt} on April 4, 1975, with {Gates/nr} as the CEO.In August 1977 the company formed an agreement with {ASCII Magazine/nt} in {Japan/ns} , resulting in its first international office.The company moved to a new home in {Bellevue/ns} , {Washington/ns} in January 1979.{Microsoft/nt} entered the OS business in 1980 with its own version of Unix, called Xenix.However, it was DOS (Disk Operating System) that solidified the company's dominance. After negotiations with {Digital Research/nt} failed, {IBM/nt} awarded a contract to {Microsoft/nt} to provide a version of the CP/MOS, which was set to be used in the upcoming {IBM/nt} Personal Computer. For this deal, {Microsoft/nt} purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from {Seattle Computer Products/nt}, branding it as MS-DOS, which {IBM/nt} rebranded to PC-DOS. Following the release of the {IBM/nt} PC in August 1981, {Microsoft/nt} retained ownership of MS-DOS. Since {IBM/nt} copyrighted the {IBM/nt} PC BIOS, other companies had to reverse engineer it in order for hardware to run as {IBM/nt} PC compatibles, but no such restriction applied to the operating systems. Due to various factors, such as MS-DOS's available software selection, {Microsoft/nt} eventually became the leading PC OS vendor.{Paul Allen/nr} resigned from {Microsoft/nt} in February after developing Hodgkin's disease.[9]The sign at a main entrance to the {Microsoft/nt} corporate campus in {Redmond/ns}. In May 2005 the campus stretched more than 750,000 m2 (approx. 8 million square feet) and contained over 30,000 employees.While jointly developing a new OS with {IBM/nt} in 1985, OS/2, {Microsoft/nt} released Microsoft Windows, a graphical extension for MS-DOS, on November 20.{Microsoft/nt} moved its headquarters to {Redmond/ns} on February 26, 1986, and on March 13 the company went public;the ensuing rise in the tock would make an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from {Microsoft/nt} employees.Due to the partnership with {IBM/nt}, in 1990 the {Federal Trade Commission/nt} set its eye on {Microsoft/nt} for possible collusion; it marked the beginning of over a decade of legal clashes with the {U.S./nt} Government.{Microsoft/nt} announced the release of its version of OS/2 to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) on April 2, 1987;meanwhile, the company was at work on a 32-bit OS, Microsoft Windows NT, using ideas from OS/2; it shipped on July 21, 1993 with a new modular kernel and the Win32 application programming interface (API), making porting from 16-bit (MS-DOS-based) Windows easier. Once {Microsoft/nt} informed {IBM/nt} of NT, the OS/2 partnership deteriorated.{Microsoft/nt} introduced its office suitem in 1990. The software bundled separate office productivity applications, such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel.On May 22 {Microsoft/nt} launched Windows 3.0 with a streamlined user interface graphics and improved protected mode capability for the Intel 386 processor.Both Office and Windows became dominant in their respective areas.Novell, a Word competitor from 1984–1986, filed a lawsuit years later claiming that {Microsoft/nt} left part of its APIs undocumented in order to gain a competitive advantage.{Bill Gates/nr} giving his deposition in 1998 for the {United States/ns} v. {Microsoft/nt} trial. Once the {U.S. Department of Justice/nt} 1993 took over from the {Federal Trade Commission/nt}, a protracted legal wrangling between {Microsoft/nt} and the department ensued, resulting in various settlements and possible blocked mergers. {Microsoft/nt} would point to companies such  as {AOL-Time Warner/nt} in its defense.Following {Bill Gates/nr}'s internal "Internet Tidal Wave memo" on May 26, 1995  {Microsoft/nt} began to redefine its offerings and expand its product line into computer networking and the World Wide Web. The company released Windows 95 on August 24, 1995, featuring pre-emptive multitasking, a completely new user interface with a  novel start button, and 32-bit compatibility; similar to NT, it provided the Win32 API.Windows 95 came bundled with the online  service MSN, and for OEMs Internet Explorer, a web browser. Internet Explorer was not bundled with the retail Windows 95 boxes  because the boxes were printed before the team finished the web browser, and instead was included in the Windows 95 Plus! pack. Branching out into new markets in 1996, {Microsoft/nt} and {NBC Universal/nt} created a new 24/7 cable news station, MSNBC. {Microsoft/nt} created Windows CE 1.0, a new OS designed for devices with low memory and other constraints, such as personal  digital assistants.In October 1997, the {Justice Department/nt} filed a motion in the {Federal District Court/nt}, stating that  {Microsoft/nt} violated an agreement signed in 1994 and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.{Bill Gates/nr} handed over the CEO position on January 13, 2000 to {Steve Ballmer/nr} , an old college friend of {Gates/nr} and employee of the company since 1980, creating a new position for himself as Chief Software Architect.Various companies including {Microsoft/nt} formed the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance in October 1999 to, among other things, increase security and protect intellectual property through identifying changes in hardware and software. Critics decry the alliance as a way enforce indiscriminate restrictions over how consumers use software, and over how computers behave, a form of digital rights management; for example the scenario where a computer is not only secured for its owner, but also secured against its owner as well.On April 3, 2000, a judgment was handed down in the case of {United States/ns} v. {Microsoft/nt},calling the company an "abusive monopoly";[33] it settled with the {U.S. Department of Justice/nt} in 2004.[12] On October 25, 2001 {Microsoft/nt} released Windows XP, unifying the mainstream and NT lines under the NT codebase.[34] The company released the Xbox later that year, entering the game console market dominated by {Sony/nt}  and {Nintendo/nt} .[35] In March 2004 the {European Union/nt} brought antitrust legal action against the company, citing it abused its dominance with the Windows OS, resulting in a judgment of €497 million ($613 million) and to produce new versions of Windows XP without Windows Media Player, Windows XP Home Edition N and Windows XP Professional N.[36][37] CEO {Steve Ballmer/nr}  at the MIX event in 2008.

It is also a member of the {C9 League/nt} in {China/ns}.{Shanghai Jiao Tong/nt} also annually produces the respected Academic Ranking of World Universities. In 1896, {Nanyang Public School/nt} was founded in {Shanghai/ns} by an imperial edict issued by {Guangxu Emperor/nr}, under the {Business and Telegraphs Office/nt} of the imperial government. Four schools were established: the normal school, school of foreign studies, middle school and a high school. {Sheng Xuanhuai/nr}, the proposer of the edict, became the first president and was regarded as the founder of the university.In 1904, the {Ministry of Commerce/nt} took over the school, and one year later changed its name to {Imperial Polytechnic College of the Commerce Ministry/nt}. In 1906, the college was placed under the {Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs/nt}, and its name was changed to {Shanghai Industrial College of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs/nt}. When the {Republic of China/nt} was founded, the college was run by the {Ministry of Communications/nt} and its name was once again changed, this time to {Government Institute of Technology of the Communications Ministry/nt}. In 1918, the republic government founded the {School of Management/nt} and it became one of the oldest academic institutes.In 1920, the institute merged with two other colleges and changed its name to {Nan Yang College of Chiao Tung/nt}. In the 1930s, it was known as the "Eastern MIT"[3] due to its reputation of nurturing top engineers. In 1938, the {Ministry of Education/nt} took over the university and renamed it {National Chiao Tung University/nt}. In 1943, the graduate school was founded.After the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the new Communist government adopted a policy of creating Soviet-style specialized schools. Under this policy, some faculties of the university were incorporated into other universities. At the same time, engineering faculties from outside were absorbed to create a specialized engineering university. A bigger rearrangement came in 1956 for the school when the national government decided to send a significant amount of its faculties to {Xi'an/ns} to help create another top engineering school - {Xi'an Jiaotong University/ns} in western Chinese province {Shaanxi/ns}. Afterwards, the school was officially renamed {Shanghai Jiao Tong University/nt}.{Shanghai Second Medical University/nt} was merged into {Shanghai Jiao Tong University/nt} on July 18, 2005, under the name {Medical School of Shanghai Jiao Tong University/nt}.At present, the university comprises 20 academic schools, two directly affiliated departments and one graduate school. It also has a School of Continuing Education/nt, School of Online Learning, School of International Education, and a Vocational School. There are 60 undergraduate programs, 179 master-degree programs, 6 professional master-degree programs, 22 disciplines and 143 sub-disciplines authorized to confer Ph.D degrees, 23 post-doctorate programs, 22 state key doctorate programs and six state key laboratories and four national engineering centers. Its total enrollment of full-time students amounts over 38,000. There are 19,432 undergraduates, 13,628 candidates for Master's Degree and Doctor's Degree and 2,080 foreign students[4].

The approaches to the main gate were via a series of marble bridges, similar to, although smaller than, those built in front of {Tiananmen/ns}. However, recent road expansions have demolished the river as well as most of bridges. A copy of this famous gate scene have been built on the east of {Minhang/ns} campus.The construction of the campus never came to an end in the past century. Existing buildings: the Medium College building(built in 1898), the original library (built in 1919), the gymnasium (built in 1925), the administrative building (built in 1933), the Xinjian building (built in 1953), the new Upper College building (built in 1955), the second teaching building (built in 1960), {Bao Zhaolong/nr} library (built in 1985) and {Haoran/nt} high-tech building (built in 1996) were constructed one after another.The university's School of International Education is located here, where a large number of international students take classes throughout the academic year (however, most international students that take degree courses are in {Minhang/ns} campus). The campus still houses a variety of scientific research institutions, State Key Laboratory of Ocean Engineering,for instance, although most moved to the new campus since 1987.The {Minhang/ns} campus is located in the {Minhang District/ns} on the outskirts of metropolitan {Shanghai/ns}. This young campus, which was founded in 1987, covers 2,822,903m2 once farmland. {Zizhu Science Park/ns}, where {Intel/nt}, {ST Microelectronics/nt}, {Microsoft/nt} and other high-tech companies put their research and development centers, is to the south of the campus.Currently, most administrative and academic framework of the university and the majority of undergraduate and graduate students have situated in this campus, which is now accompanied by the newly built {Minhang Campus of East China Normal University/nt}.
